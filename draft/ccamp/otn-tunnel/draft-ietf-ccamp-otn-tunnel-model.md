--- abstract

This document describes the YANG data model for tunnels in OTN TE
networks.  The model can be used to do the configuration in order to
establish the tunnel in OTN network.  This work is independent with
the control plane protocols.

# Introduction

OTN transport networks, specified in {{ITU-T_G.709}}, can carry various
types of client signals.  In many cases, the client signal is carried
over an OTN tunnel across connected domains in a multi-domain
network.

This document provides YANG model for creating OTN tunnel.  The model
augments the generic TE Tunnel model specified in
{{!I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te}}.

The YANG module ietf-otn-tunnel defined in this document conforms to
the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in
{{!RFC8342}}.

## Terminology and Notations

Refer to {{!I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang}} for the OTN specific terms
terms used in this document.

The following terms are defined in {{!RFC7950}} and are not redefined
here:

-  client

-  server

-  augment

-  data model

-  data node

The following terms are defined in {{!RFC6241}} and are not redefined
here:

{: #tab-prefixes title="Prefixes and corresponding YANG modules"}

RFC Editor Note: Please replace XXXX with the number assigned to the
RFC once this draft becomes an RFC.  Please replace YYYY with the RFC

ZZZZ with the RFC numbers assigned to {{!I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te}}.

# OTN Tunnel Model Description

## Overview of OTN Tunnel Model

This document aims to describe the data model for OTN tunnel.  The
OTN tunnel model is using TE tunnel {{!I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te}} as a
basic model and augments it with OTN-specific parameters, including
the bandwidth information and label information.  {{fig-overview}} shows the
augmentation relationship.

It is also worth noting that the OTN tunnel provisioning is usually
based on the OTN topology.  Therefore the OTN tunnel model is usually
used together with OTN topology model specified in
{{!I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang}}.  The OTN tunnel model also imports a
few type modules, including ietf-layer1-types, ietf-te-types and
ietf-inet-types.  The OTN-specific attributes in {{!RFC7139}}, including
the Tributary Slot (TS) and Tributary Port Number (TPN), can be used
to represent the bandwidth and label information.  These attributes
have been specified in {{!I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types}} and used in this
document for augmentation of the generic TE tunnel model.

More scenarios and model applications can be found in
{{?I-D.ietf-ccamp-transport-nbi-app-statement}} and
{{?I-D.ietf-teas-actn-yang}}.

## Bandwidth Augmentation

The model augments all the occurrences of the te-bandwidth container
with the OTN technology specific attributes using the otn-link-
bandwidth and otn-path-bandwidth groupings defined in
{{!I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types}}.

## Label Augmentation

The model augments all the occurrences of the label-restriction list
with OTN technology specific attributes using the otn-label-range-
info grouping defined in {{!I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types}}.

Moreover, the model augments all the occurrences of the te-label
container with the OTN technology specific attributes using the otn-
label-start-end, otn-label-hop and otn-label-step groupings defined
in {{!I-D.ietf-ccamp-layer1-types}}.

# Security Considerations

The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
as NETCONF {{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF layer
is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
{{!RFC8446}}.

The NETCONF access control model {{!RFC8341}} provides the means to
restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
operations and content.

There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 10 of
{{!I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te}} are also applicable to their subtrees in the
module defined in this document.

Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
notification) to these data nodes.  Considerations in Section 10 of
{{!I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te}} are also applicable to their subtrees in the
module defined in this document.
